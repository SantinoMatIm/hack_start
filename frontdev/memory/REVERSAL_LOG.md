# Reversal Log

**Frontend Decision Intelligence Engineering Organization**

---

## Purpose

This document records decisions that were made and later reversed. Reversals are not failures — they are learning. Recording them prevents repeating mistakes and helps understand why certain approaches don't work.

---

## Reversal Format

```
## REV-{number}: {Title}

**Original Decision**: [What was decided]
**Decision Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Reversal Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Session**: [Session where reversal occurred]

**Original Rationale**: [Why we thought it was right]
**What Happened**: [What went wrong or changed]
**Reversal Rationale**: [Why we changed course]
**Lesson Learned**: [What we should remember]
```

## Reversals

### REV-001: [Template - No reversals yet]

**Original Decision**: [Placeholder]
**Decision Date**: —
**Reversal Date**: —
**Session**: —

**Original Rationale**: 
[This is a template entry. Real reversals will be documented here as they occur.]

**What Happened**: 
[Description of what went wrong or what new information emerged]

**Reversal Rationale**: 
[Why the reversal was necessary]

**Lesson Learned**: 
[What the organization should remember]

## Reversal Patterns

As reversals accumulate, we should identify patterns:

### Common Reversal Causes
- Insufficient user feedback
- Technical constraints discovered late
- Principle conflicts not anticipated
- Scope creep leading to complexity
- Accessibility issues found post-implementation

### Reversal Prevention
- Earlier user validation
- Technical spike before implementation
- Adversary review at Phase 1
- Accessibility review at Phase 2
- Scope discipline in intent

## How to Log a Reversal

1. Assign next sequential number
2. Document original decision completely
3. Explain what happened objectively
4. Extract lesson learned
5. Update LESSONS_LEARNED.md if broadly applicable
6. Consider governance updates if systemic

## Reversal Philosophy

> **Reversals are data, not failures.**

- Every reversal teaches something
- The goal is fewer reversals over time
- But never avoid reversal to avoid admitting error
- A known-wrong decision persisted is worse than a reversal

*This log will grow as the organization matures. An empty log means no learning.*
