# INTENT

## Session: 2026-01-31-footer-workflow-fix

## Current State

1. **Workflow Section**: White container below hero appears empty in screenshot - nav cards not visible
2. **Footer**: Uses dark background (#0A0F1A) that doesn't match the light, minimal page design

## Identified Gaps

| Gap | Impact on Decision-Making | Severity |
|-----|---------------------------|----------|
| Empty workflow section | Users cannot navigate to Risk/Actions/Simulation pages | Critical |
| Mismatched footer | Visual inconsistency reduces perceived quality/trust | Minor |

## Hypotheses

1. If we ensure nav-cards have proper visibility and content, users can navigate the decision workflow
2. If we redesign the footer to use light styling matching the page, the visual coherence improves

## Proposed Changes

| Change | Create/Modify/Delete | Rationale |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Fix workflow nav-cards visibility | Modify | Critical for navigation |
| Redesign footer to light theme | Modify | Visual consistency |

## Risks
- None significant - these are visual fixes that don't affect functionality

## Approval
- [x] Proceeding with fixes (visual bug fixes, urgent)
