### How It Works

{Brief explanation of current behavior}

### Where It Lives

| Component | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| {component} | {file path} |

## Identified Gaps

| Gap | Impact on Decision-Making | Severity |
|-----|---------------------------|----------|
| {Gap description} | {How this hurts user decisions} | Critical / Major / Minor |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Hypotheses

State testable hypotheses about how changes will improve decision-making.

1. **If we** {change X}, **then** {improvement Y} **because** {rationale Z}

2. **If we** {change X}, **then** {improvement Y} **because** {rationale Z}
