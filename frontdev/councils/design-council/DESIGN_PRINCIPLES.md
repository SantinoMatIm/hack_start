# Design Principles

## Purpose

These principles guide all visual and interaction design decisions.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Decoration

Every visual element must serve comprehension. Decorative elements that don't aid decision-making should be questioned.

**Apply**:
- Does this element help users understand?
- Could this be simpler?
- What happens if we remove it?

### 2. Urgency Is Felt, Not Just Read

Time pressure must be communicated through visual treatment, not just numbers. As risk increases, the interface must escalate visually.

**Apply**:
- Would a colorblind user perceive urgency?
- Would a stressed user feel the time pressure?
- Does visual escalation match risk escalation?

### 3. Consequences Are Visible

The difference between acting and not acting must be viscerally clear. Comparison is visual, not computational.

**Apply**:
- Can users see both futures?
- Is the delta prominent?
- Does "cost of inaction" register?

### 4. Premium Minimalism

Sophisticated simplicity, not bare functionality. The interface should feel premium while remaining focused.

**Apply**:
- Does this feel professional?
- Is there visual noise?
- Does it inspire confidence?

### 5. Hierarchy Guides Attention

Visual hierarchy must guide users to what matters most. Primary decisions get primary visual weight.

**Apply**:
- What draws the eye first?
- Is the hierarchy clear?
- Does importance match visual weight?

### 6. Motion With Purpose

Animation serves comprehension, not performance. Every motion must guide attention or communicate state.

**Apply**:
- What does this animation teach?
- Could users understand without it?
- Does it respect reduced motion preferences?

### 7. Accessible By Default

Accessibility is not an add-on. Every design decision must consider diverse abilities and crisis conditions.

**Apply**:
- Does this work for colorblind users?
- Does this work under stress?
- Does this meet WCAG AA?

### 8. Consistency Enables Speed

Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load. Users shouldn't learn new patterns for each page.

**Apply**:
- Does this match established patterns?
- If not, is deviation justified?
- Will users recognize this pattern?

## Principle Hierarchy

When principles conflict:

1. **Clarity** — If it's not clear, nothing else matters
2. **Accessibility** — Cannot be traded for aesthetics
3. **Urgency Communication** — Core mission requirement
4. **Consistency** — Supports speed and reduces errors
5. **Premium Minimalism** — Nice to have, not essential

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|--------------|----------------|
| Dashboard theater | Beautiful but passive |
| Visual noise | Competes for attention |
| False neutrality | Treating all info as equally important |
| Animation for its own sake | Distracts, doesn't inform |
| Hidden complexity | Critical data behind interactions |
| Inconsistent escalation | Urgency colors used arbitrarily |
