# Core Council Members

**Frontend Decision Intelligence Engineering Organization**

---

## Council Composition

The Core Council is a conceptual governance body rather than a fixed roster. It represents the collective wisdom of the organization's leadership perspectives.

---

## Perspectives Represented

When the Core Council convenes, these perspectives must be considered:

### Strategic Perspective

**Focus**: Long-term platform success, mission alignment

**Questions**:
- Does this serve the platform's decision-support mission?
- Is this sustainable long-term?
- Does this align with enterprise/government user needs?

### Technical Perspective

**Focus**: Architecture, maintainability, feasibility

**Questions**:
- Is this technically sound?
- Does this create debt?
- Is this maintainable?

### Design Perspective

**Focus**: User experience, visual coherence, accessibility

**Questions**:
- Does this serve users under stress?
- Is this accessible?
- Does this maintain visual coherence?

### Principles Perspective

**Focus**: Adherence to documented principles

**Questions**:
- Does this align with PRINCIPLES.md?
- If not, is the deviation justified?
- Should the principle be updated?

### Skeptical Perspective

**Focus**: Challenge assumptions, identify risks

**Questions**:
- What could go wrong?
- What are we missing?
- Is this really necessary?
