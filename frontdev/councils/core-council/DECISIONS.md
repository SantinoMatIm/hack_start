1. Ad-hoc development without formal structure
2. Lightweight guidelines only
3. Full organizational structure with governance

**Decision**: Establish complete Frontend Decision Intelligence Engineering Organization with:
- Council structure
- Specialized pods
- Session-based workflow
- Comprehensive governance

**Rationale**:
- High-stakes decision interface requires rigorous approach
- Multiple decision moments require coordinated development
- Enterprise/government users require accountability and traceability
- Long-term coherence requires institutional memory

**Implementation**:
- Create frontdev/ folder structure
- Document all governance rules
- Establish session workflow
- Define specialist roles

**Review Date**: After 5 completed sessions, evaluate effectiveness

### DEC-002: Principle Set Adoption

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Status**: Approved
**Requested By**: Organization establishment

**Context**:
Needed to define core principles that would guide all frontend work.

**Decision**: Adopt 10 core principles:
1. Decision Primacy
2. Truth Over Comfort
3. Urgency Is Visual
4. Consequences Before Features
5. Explainable Over Magical
6. Accessibility Is Non-Negotiable
7. No Dashboard Theater
8. Skepticism As Process
9. Profile Differentiation Is Real
10. Code Is The Artifact

**Rationale**:
Each principle addresses a specific challenge in building decision interfaces for high-stakes water risk management.

**Implementation**:
Documented in PRINCIPLES.md. All sessions must align with these principles.

### DEC-003: Three-Phase Session Workflow

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Status**: Approved
**Requested By**: Organization establishment

**Context**:
Needed to define how frontend work is conducted.

**Decision**: Adopt three-phase workflow:
1. Intent & Gaps (before coding)
2. Implementation (code work)
3. Fidelity Review (quality gate)

**Rationale**:
- Phase 1 prevents building the wrong thing
- Phase 2 is where work happens
- Phase 3 ensures decision-support quality

**Implementation**:
Documented in SESSION_PROTOCOL.md. All sessions follow this workflow.
