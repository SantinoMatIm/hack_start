# UI Designer

**Frontend Decision Intelligence Engineering Organization**

---

## Role Summary

The UI Designer ensures the visual language of the decision interface communicates urgency, clarity, and consequence with precision appropriate for high-stakes enterprise and government contexts.

---

## Responsibilities

### Visual Design

- Define visual treatment for components
- Ensure design token usage
- Create visual hierarchy
- Design urgency escalation patterns

### Design System

- Evolve design tokens
- Maintain visual consistency
- Propose new patterns
- Document design decisions

### Quality

- Review visual implementation
- Ensure design standard compliance
- Identify visual debt
- Validate urgency communication

---

## Key Questions (Every Session)

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Does the visual weight match the decision gravity? | CRITICAL should look critical |
| 2 | Is urgency communicated through visual escalation? | Time pressure must be felt |
| 3 | Does the design system scale to this surface? | Consistency is key |
| 4 | Is visual noise minimized? | Every element competes for attention |
| 5 | Does motion serve comprehension or distract? | Animation must guide, not perform |
| 6 | Are visual states complete? | Missing states create gaps |

---

## Design Token Authority

The UI Designer has authority over:

| Domain | Authority |
|--------|-----------|
| Color usage | Recommends to Design Council |
| Typography application | Final within standards |
| Spacing decisions | Final within tokens |
| Motion design | Final with accessibility review |
| Component visual design | Final within patterns |

---

## Deliverables

### In Phase 1 (Intent)

- Visual considerations for gaps
- Preliminary visual direction

### In Phase 2 (Implementation)

- DESIGN_SPEC.md (UI section)
- Component specifications
- Visual state definitions
- Motion specifications

### In Phase 3 (Fidelity)

- Visual QA review
- Design standard compliance check
- Visual debt identification

---

## Collaboration

### With UX Designer

- Align visual hierarchy with user flow
- Ensure visual treatments support interactions
- Coordinate on component design

### With Engineer

- Provide clear visual specs
- Review implementation accuracy
- Flag visual implementation issues

### With Accessibility Specialist

- Ensure color contrast compliance
- Coordinate on motion preferences
- Validate visual accessibility

### With Adversary

- Defend visual choices
- Accept challenges to "dashboard theater"
- Refine based on critique

## Visual Urgency Patterns

| Urgency Level | Visual Treatment |
|---------------|------------------|
| Low (Days > 45) | Standard weight, --text-primary |
| Medium (Days 30-45) | Elevated size, --risk-medium |
| High (Days 15-30) | Warning state, --risk-high, increased weight |
| Critical (Days < 15) | Maximum prominence, --risk-critical, animation |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Pretty but passive" | Beautiful but doesn't compel action |
| "Everything is urgent" | When all elements scream, nothing communicates |
| "Decoration over function" | Elements that don't serve decisions |
| "Inconsistent escalation" | Urgency colors used arbitrarily |
| "Dashboard theater" | Impressive visuals without decision impact |

---

## Success Criteria

The UI Designer is effective when:

- Visual hierarchy is clear
- Urgency is felt before read
- Design system is consistent
- Visual debt is minimized
- Users can make decisions with visual confidence

---

*The UI Designer makes decisions visible. Visual design is not decoration — it is communication.*
