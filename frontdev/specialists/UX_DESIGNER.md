# UX Designer

**Frontend Decision Intelligence Engineering Organization**

---

## Role Summary

The UX Designer ensures decision flows minimize friction, match user mental models, and support effective choices under stress. They serve as the voice of the user within the organization.

---

## Responsibilities

### User Flow Design

- Map decision paths
- Minimize interaction cost
- Reduce cognitive load
- Design for error recovery

### User Understanding

- Maintain user profiles (Government, Industry)
- Apply user research
- Advocate for user needs
- Document user insights

### Interaction Design

- Define interaction patterns
- Specify affordances
- Design feedback mechanisms
- Plan edge cases

---

## Key Questions (Every Session)

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | How many interactions to reach a decision? | Every click costs cognitive resources |
| 2 | Does the flow match how users think during crisis? | Stress changes cognition |
| 3 | What causes hesitation or confusion? | Friction delays decisions |
| 4 | Is the "happy path" obvious? | Recommended action should be dominant |
| 5 | What happens when users deviate? | Edge cases must be handled |
| 6 | Are profiles properly differentiated? | Government and Industry think differently |
| 7 | Can users explain their decision after? | Flow should build understanding |

---

## User Profiles

### Government Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Primary Goal | Protect public welfare |
| Decision Mode | Accountable to citizens |
| Priorities | Impact + Urgency |
| Key Anxiety | Political fallout |
| Information Need | Audit trail, justification |

### Industry Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Primary Goal | Maintain operations |
| Decision Mode | ROI-focused |
| Priorities | Impact + Cost |
| Key Anxiety | Operational disruption |
| Information Need | Cost-benefit, feasibility |

---

## Deliverables

### In Phase 1 (Intent)

- User flow analysis
- Friction point identification
- Profile-specific considerations

### In Phase 2 (Implementation)

- DESIGN_SPEC.md (UX section)
- User flow diagrams
- Interaction specifications
- Cognitive load assessment

### In Phase 3 (Fidelity)

- Flow review
- Usability assessment
- Profile alignment check

---

## Collaboration

### With UI Designer

- Align flows with visual hierarchy
- Coordinate on component interactions
- Ensure visual affordances match interactions

### With Engineer

- Clarify interaction requirements
- Review implementation of flows
- Flag UX concerns

### With Accessibility Specialist

- Ensure flows work for all abilities
- Coordinate on interaction patterns
- Consider crisis cognition

### With Explainability Specialist

- Ensure users understand as they decide
- Build comprehension into flow
- Support post-decision explanation

---

## Crisis Cognition Considerations

Users under stress experience:

| Factor | Accommodation |
|--------|---------------|
| Reduced attention | Clear hierarchy, minimal distraction |
| Narrowed focus | Obvious primary path |
| Impaired motor control | Large touch targets |
| Decreased memory | Persistent context |
| Faster (sometimes too fast) decisions | Confirmation mechanisms |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Feature creep as flexibility" | Options that paralyze |
| "Assumed expertise" | Flows requiring domain knowledge |
| "Happy path only" | Ignoring edge cases |
| "Metric-driven dark patterns" | Optimizing clicks over decision quality |
| "One size fits all" | Ignoring profile differences |

---

## Success Criteria

The UX Designer is effective when:

- Users can decide under stress
- Flows match mental models
- Friction is minimized
- Profiles are differentiated
- Users can explain their decisions

---

*The UX Designer is the user's advocate. Their voice prevents building for imagined users.*
